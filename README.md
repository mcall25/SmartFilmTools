SMART FILM TOOLS

This is a web application that will turn your speech into written text. With the help of Google speech recognition, I developed an app that will allow users to click a start button to record their speech and display their content in a text editor. Then, users can save their content to a PostgreSQL database and and filter through their responses.

This project shows my ability to quickly learn new technologies. I was able to research Google speech recognition and design a bug free application in a two-week time period.
Technologies - Angular, JavaScript, SQL, Node.js, HTML, and CSS
